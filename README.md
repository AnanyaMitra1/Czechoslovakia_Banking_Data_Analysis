# Czechoslovakia Banking Financial Data Analysis Overview

In this project, I focused on analyzing financial data from the Czechoslovakia Bank over a 5-year period (2018-2022). The dataset comprised 8 tables: clients, accounts, cards, loans, transactions, districts, disposition, and orders. My primary objective was to provide actionable insights to the bank, enabling informed decision-making regarding their financial operations.

## Key Components

### Data Cleaning and Preparation:

I ensured data quality by cleaning and transforming raw data using tools such as Excel and SQL. Continuous data ingestion from AWS to Snowflake ensured up-to-date information.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

I delved into the dataset to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies. EDA helped me uncover valuable insights that drove decision-making.

### Ad-hoc Data Analysis:

I sought answers to critical questions for the Czechoslovakia Bank:
- Demographic Profiling: I understood client demographics across different districts.
- Account and Card Usage: I identified common account and card types.
- Expense and Loan Portfolio Analysis: I evaluated the bankâ€™s financial health.
- Customer Service Enhancement: I explored ways to improve satisfaction levels.

## Business Impact

The results of my analysis empowered the Czechoslovakia Bank to enhance its financial operations. By leveraging these insights, the bank could make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and potentially introduce new financial products or services.
